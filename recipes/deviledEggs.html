<p>If you're looking for an introduction to deviled eggs, this is the place to start: just eggs, mustard, mayonnaise, a dash of Tabasco and a festive sprinkle of paprika (or jazz things up with a garnish of chives). They are a simple and spectacular addition to a holiday table.</p>

<ul>
<li>6 large eggs</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
<li>1 to 2dashes Tabasco sauce, to taste
Salt, to taste</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives</li>
<li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise
Paprika, for garnish
Whole fresh chives, for garnish</li>
</ul>

<ol>

<li>Rinse eggs with warm water, and place in a small saucepan. Cover with cold water, place the pan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Turn off heat, cover and let sit for 10-12 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water and peel. Cool in the refrigerator, loosely covered, for 15 minutes.</li><br>
<li>Halve eggs lengthwise, and carefully scoop out yolks. Place yolks in a bowl, and mash with a fork. Add mustard, Tabasco, salt, pepper and snipped chives. Stir in mayonnaise.</li><br>
<li>Fill each egg white with about 1Â½ teaspoons of the egg-yolk mixture and dust the top with paprika. Arrange in a spoke design on a platter; garnish with whole chives.</li>
